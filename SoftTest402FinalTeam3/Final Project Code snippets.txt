Code to be added to the Test Framework Helper file:

requires:  using System.Diagnostics;

	/// <summary>
        /// Creates a Process object
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="appPath">The fully qualified path to the application to be used by the Process object</param>
        /// <returns>a Process object</returns>
        public static Process CreateProcess(string appPath)
        {
            Process np = new Process();
            np.StartInfo.FileName = appPath;
            np.StartInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Normal;
            return np;
        }



Code to be added to the TED Constant file.  Please feel free to rename, I'll make sure my code matches whatever
these constants are named once we get the code uploaded to GitHub.

	public enum TEDMainMenu : int
        {
            file = 0,
            edit = 1,
            search = 2,
            tools = 3,
            favourites = 4,
            clips = 5, 
            options = 6,
            help = 7
        }
        
        //Constants for the File submenu items
        public enum FileMenu : int
        {
            newFile = 0, 
            open = 1,
            revert = 2,
            reOpen = 3,
            import = 4,
            include = 5,
            save = 7,
            saveAs = 8,
            export = 9,
            exclude = 10,
            encoding = 12,
            newLines = 13,
            properties = 14,
            pageSetUp = 16,
            print = 17,
            recentFiles = 19,
            hideToTray = 21,
            newWindow = 22, 
            saveNExit = 24,
            exit = 25

        }
